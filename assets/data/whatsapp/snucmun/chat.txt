So be sure of the dates and the money you'll have to spend before you add your names to the list. <This message was edited>

30/08/24, 6:13 pm - +91 75501 05405: what's the fees for this mun (if any)
30/08/24, 6:14 pm - Kevin Samson SNUC IOT: Disclaimer: It'll cost somewhere around 2,000 rupees to delegate in these upcoming MUNs (inclusive of food), but if you win accolades, you stand to gain back a lot more, including the money. So be sure of the dates and the money you'll have to spend before you add your names to the list.
30/08/24, 6:14 pm - Kevin Samson SNUC IOT: And it'll clash with Invente, a collegewide event that happens once a year

> Do you find yourself debating with a wall on various issues of interest?
> Perhaps you're craving something novel to dip your toes into!
> Or maybe — you're just looking for the perfect excuse to suit up and feast in style
If any of this arouses your interest, then *great news*!

Lying at the intersection of debate and geopolitics are the Model United Nations, and we — *the SSN MUN Society welcome you to our Orientation session!* 

*You'll understand the ABCs of what happens in a MUN* , how delegating and reporting work, and how our society became one of the big dawgs in the Chennai MUN Circuit! 

And if you stick around, we have a *workshop* where you can unravel *the Art of Delegating* — consisting of *the strategies* you can employ in different committees *to rise above the competition!* 

*Venue* : Central Seminar Hall at the ECE Annexure Block
*Date* : Monday, 16th September 2024
*Timings* : 2:30-3:30 pm
*Workshop* : 3:30-5:30 pm
(Don’t fret, 5:45 buses will be available)

What will you get out of participating in MUNs?
1. You'll improve your *understanding of history, geopolitics and foreign affairs* .
2. You'll get to practice and *improve your oratory and writing skills* .
3. You'll get to *escape the monotonous academic drudgery* and *network with students across different colleges* .
4. There are also *cash prizes* if you win!
Even if none of this convinces you — *give the orientation a shot!*

You'll never know you like something unless you venture out of your zone and pursue something new :)

21/03/25, 12:44 pm - +91 99625 94864: Hey guys! 
*SSN SNUC IntraMUN Round 1 registrations are open now !!!*

Have you ever felt that debate seems like just a two-sided conversation, public speaking is all about your stage fear and serious role play seems too childish for someone in college? Maybe you tried your hand at these, maybe you liked seeing epic pictures of yourself speaking with a mic. Maybe you just like something new, something interesting, something that challenges you no matter how good you are.

Enter MUNs, an action-packed set of events that bring everything we mentioned into a chaotic but enthralling display of the countries of the world, where using all of these talents isn't impossible, it's necessary.

Luckily for you, SSN and SNUC MUN Societies have come together to bring you the first ever edition of SSN-SNUC Intra MUN taking place in our campus on April 2nd and 3rd! 

This is your chance to dive into the wonderful world of MUNs, learn the tricks of the trade from your seniors, and be a part of the esteemed SSN-SNUC Delegation, one of the most successful delegating teams in South India!

We have a wide range from the military focused UNGA and human rights obsessed HRC, to the champion of economics ECOSOC, and the head honcho of the United Nations, the UNSC. And if delegating doesn't seem to be your thing, come report for the International Press as a Journalist or a Photographer, and record the action as it unfolds!


How do you get into the Society? 

Step 1: Find our intra MUN page in insta 

https://www.instagram.com/ssnsnucintramun?igsh=Y29qeHJkYmF2NGJp

Step 2: Pick a committee that interests you the most and figure out which country you want to represent! 

Step 3: Register using the links in the page and enter the conference with a registration fee.

Step 4: Show up to the conference on the blocked dates, and compete for prizes within a pool of ₹50,000 (yeah, you heard that right), avail complimentary lunch, On Duty provisions and most of all, an amazing experience.

See you there delegates!
22/03/25, 9:48 pm - +91 99625 94864: Do you have what it takes to command the UNSC, shape global policies in ECOSOC, or defend human rights in HRC? Maybe you’re ready to address military policy in the UNGA, or even capture the drama as part of the International Press? 📰

Reasons to join us at SSN-SNUC IntraMUN!🌏

We are pleased to announce that *Mahasvan (@⁨~Mahasvan⁩) has been elected as President* and *Shreya (@⁨~Shreya N⁩) as Secretary*, both unopposed.

We would like to congratulate Mahasvan and Shreya on their achievement and wish them the very best as they take on their new roles. We are confident they will carry out their responsibilities with dedication and commitment. <This message was edited>
15/04/25, 2:14 pm - +91 72003 20804: Hi, I’m Mahasvan, and I was going to start campaigning soon™ 

It’s an honor to be president of this club, and I hope I can carry forward the legacy that the delegation has created for itself in the past two years. 

Shreya is one of the most active people in the club currently, and I’m so glad she’s secretary. I think there’s no one more deserving to be on the core committee than her. Congrats to you!

All candidates for the vp and jointsec, whom I personally know, are great in their own ways, and I wish all of you the best for the elections! 

Hopefully we can do good by you this academic year, and leave the club in a better place than we are in now. We’ll need your help for it though. Believe in us, and most importantly, SIVADARSHINI, BELIEVE YOURSELF! <This message was edited>

When I first started delegating, the only person I knew from this club was Mahasvan (last year’s Director General of the inter SSN-SNUC MUN), and we had @⁨~Adhithya Viswanathan⁩  delegating as well. When we went as the SSN-SNUC delegation, it was honestly disheartening to see the initial turnout from SNU. But I’m genuinely proud of how far we’ve come, and I really hope even more people join us this year.

This time, Adhi couldn’t be part of the core due to other commitments, but I still want to mention him here because he truly contributed a lot over the past two years :)

I wish all the very best to  our worthy candidates andI'm extremely proud to see each and every one of you here contesting. Intra MUN genuinely made me believe that we have an amazing future as a club, and we can make it all worth it if you guys continue delegating.

As the Secretary of this club and the Director General, SNU, for this year’s inter SSN-SNUC MUN edition, I’ll do my absolute best to ensure that first-timers become second-timers and don’t stop delegating because my seniors believed in me even when I made mistakes. I’ve realised that the only thing that truly matters is the support and the amazing people standing beside you in the delegation.

And honestly, if more people from our club actively delegate, we along with the SSN ,will become a true power delegation. There’s a vision I have, and I believe Mahasvan, @⁨~Mahasvan⁩ as President, is the perfect person to bring it to life.

I hope this resonates with you, and I’m really looking forward to working with all of you.

All the very best to all the candidates once again:))
15/04/25, 3:47 pm - +91 99625 94864: Hello everyone ,
I am Harsha vardhana anand form 3rd year IoT and I am standing for the position of vice president. I have consistently delegated for the past 3 years and I have seen the delegation grow from very few members to a huge number of participants.  I have also been among the organising committee members for the past 2 editions of Inter MUN and I was in the core committee for IntraMUN. 

 I know how the conferences work both from the perspective of a delegate and an organising committee member . I assure you that I will work hard to make this club reach a better position than it is currently and I will help every member who wishes to participate in conferences . 

So , please support me and vote for me .
15/04/25, 4:29 pm - +91 99402 55513: Hello everyone,
For those who may not know me, my name is Sudharsan Ashokkumar, though many of you might recognize me as Rakesh.  I've previously attended three conferences and was fortunate enough to receive an award at one of them. I also had the valuable experience of being part of the Organizing Committee for both SSN SNUC MUN '24 and the SSN SNUC Inter MUN, and I'm proud of the work I've put into this club. Beyond MUNs, I have strong leadership qualities and have successfully led teams in organizing several other events within the university. While I took a brief break to pursue my passion for photography, I'm eager to return to MUNs and am confident that I will be actively delegating throughout the year. Therefore, I request your vote for Joint- Secretary to continue contributing to the growth and success of our MUN Society.
15/04/25, 4:57 pm - +91 73959 20744: Heyy everybody,
I'm Tejas a first year from AI&DS,
I've been to three MUNs so far, got an Honourable Mention in my first, got absolutely humbled in my second (character development, perhaps), and managed a Verbal Mention in the third. So, clearly, I’m still figuring things out. I'd say somewhere between subpar and getting there.

But what I’ve realized through all of it is: I love this. I love the debates, the diplomacy, and most of all the drama.

I’m running for Joint Secretary not because I’ve mastered MUNs, but because I’m genuinely invested in helping us all get better - together. Whether you're a seasoned delegate or still googling what a motion is, I’ve been there (kinda still am)

So if you're looking for  someone who’ll work hard, learn fast, and has a sizable amount to offer to the table.
I’m your person.
15/04/25, 5:34 pm - +91 99624 66579: Hello all,
This is Sai Nithya, a first year cyber sec student. I started my MUN journey last year and have been to four MUNs so far. When I first entered the committee as a first timer, I was completely overwhelmed and at the same time awe-struck at my fellow experienced delegates. My first two MUNs didn't go the way I hoped and I walked out feeling like I hadn't done enough.

But I thought maybe 3rd time's the charm and in my 3rd MUN I got a verbal mention. I still felt like I could do better. In our Intramun I was awarded High Comm.
Though my journey didn't start with success, it's been one of steady growth. And through it all, it was my seniors who guided and encouraged me. Whether it was through prep sessions, last-minute tips, or just being there when I was nervous. That made a huge difference.

Now, I want to be that person for others, someone who’s approachable, fun, and genuinely helpful. If elected, I’ll make sure first-timers get the prep they need, I’ll organize prep groups, and help create a space where everyone can grow and feel confident in committee.

If you've ever felt like MUN is intimidating, I promise , we’ll change that together. 
Hope to have your support! :)
15/04/25, 7:12 pm - +91 90252 59143: Hey guys I'll spare you the details and keep it short.

I'm Gautham Gaurav, better known as GG, I've been part of the MUN culture for 3 years now, I've been to 9 MUNs as of now, out of which I've CHAIRED 2 (ik, it's an addiction). 

Didn't take up the first 5 too seriously, but won many verbal mentions, and recently got a honorable mention in our IntraMUN. I've also set up the GESMUN legacy (our school MUN) which has seen a solid growth spurt over the two years. I remember the first two college MUNs I've been to (I was fresh Outta school), where the SSN-SNU delegation mercilessly crushed the competition. I stood there wondering when I'd be a part of it, fast forward 6 months and I'm there holding the trophy with my college delegates in the SRMOCT edition 2024. Truly magical!

Eitherways I've got the experience, I've handled lots of stressed out First timers, and I simply know that when I put my mind to something, I'll make it happen.

So help me start my dream journey, and please vote for the right candidate. Thank you 😋
(Not too short.. ik).
15/04/25, 7:42 pm - Achyuth Anna SNUC: Hey everyone, this is Achyuth Mukund – a 3rd year student from CSE (IoT), and I’m contesting for the position of *Vice President* position at our very own *SNUC MUN Society* for the upcoming academic year, and I’d love your support!

With 3 years of solid leadership experience, I’ve had the privilege to serve as:  
• *Secretary* – SNUC MUN Society (2024–25) alongside @⁨~Mahasvan⁩ 
• *USG Logistics (Head of Logistics Vertical)* – SSN SNUC MUN 2024  
• *GA & LO (Liaison Officer) – Logistics* – SSN SNUC MUN 2023  

These roles have given me experience in team management, event coordination, crisis handling, and more — and I believe I’m ready to bring that experience to serve all of you as Vice President.

I may have joined the race a little late because of a really hectic day, but with your support, I know I can make it count. Let’s work together to make our year more inclusive, vibrant, and impactful!
15/04/25, 7:43 pm - Achyuth Anna SNUC: I'd also like to remind you that there are a lot of deserving and hardworking people who are contesting in this election, so please take the time to vote for the ones you believe, deserve to lead our MUNSOC in the future. Thank you!
15/04/25, 7:53 pm - +91 63820 16622: Hey guys, this is Kaustubh. I’m a first year in the Bsc Economics course. I’ve been to 3 MUNs and I’ve won an award in all of them (special mention in my first and high com in the next two), I was the school pupil leader of my school and was a head of department in CVMUN23 (my school’s MUN). I’ve had experience in delegating and I love the debate the debate that ensues however I’ve also been a part of organising and I’ve and put in the efforts from my side. I’m willing to give it my all to maintain our already amazing delegation and MUNSOC’s legacy and make it better if possible under the guidance of my seniors. So yes vote for me you wont regret it👍.
15/04/25, 8:51 pm - Krit Lunkad IoT SNUC: Hi all, this is Krit Lunkad, a 1st Year IoT student, and I’m running for Joint Secretary of our MUN Society.
After 6 MUNs and 3 awards, I’ve come to realize something deeper
It’s not just about how well you speak , it’s about how well you empower others to speak up too.
That’s why I’m running for Joint Secretary, Not to add a title to my name, but to create a space where every delegate feels ready, respected, and relentless.
I’ve seen the chaos. I’ve felt the pressure. I’ve earned the wins — not by chance, but by strategy.
Every speech, every vote, every unmod , I’ve approached it like it matters. Because it does.
But here’s what truly shifted my purpose
When I first joined MUNs, I wanted to speak.
Now, I want to lead.
Because it’s not just about how I perform , it’s about how we rise.
It’s about creating a space where first-timers walk in nervous and walk out unstoppable.
If you want leadership that’s proven, that stands beside you and doesn’t just talk 
Vote Krit for Joint Secretary.
Because your voice matters. And I’m here to make sure it’s heard ,loud, clear, and award-winning.
Let’s not just participate. Let’s dominate, together.👊🏻

15/07/25, 8:30 pm - Varun G Anna SNUC IOT: My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

Hello everyone! ✨

With the SSN-SNUC MUN just a few days away, a conference of this scale can seem like a lot, and we absolutely get it. A lot of us hesitate to register because we are unsure of how it all works, and that is completely fair.

This is exactly why we are hosting THE UNMOD - a pre-conference workshop to walk you through the flow of the committee, and help you figure out how to hold your ground when things get chaotic. Your seniors and people who’ve been in your shoes will be there to break things down and share what worked for them, while shining light on each of the committees in this edition.

📅 Date: 5th August 2025
🕝 Time: 2:30 PM – 5:30 PM
📍 Venue: SNU AB1 Seminar Hall

See you there! 
Godspeed.

A lot of you must be new to MUNs. Don't worry - we'll help you out with each step.

We're having groups for each committee, with seniors and people experienced with that comm helping you out. 
https://chat.whatsapp.com/C1IVgZbL9vA3zzODSxU2mY?mode=ems_wa_t

Make sure to check out the agendas from the instagram page https://www.instagram.com/hits_mun

Fill in the delegation sheet that's in the HITS main group description. The country matrix is also there.

So you're basically picking a country that you'll be representing, and you will also be picking a committee (diff committees let you talk about different kind of things).

Once you get your allotment from the HITS organizing team, you pay the delegate fees, and all you have to do is prep and show up to the conference in your best suit.

If you have anything to clarify, just ask in the HITS group - we are like the chillest people :)

All the best, looking forward to seeing a lot of you there!
