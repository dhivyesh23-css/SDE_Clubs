To the club in itself, thank you for letting us lead, supporting us, and making all our efforts worthwhile.

Now, it's time to hand over the legacy to the next in line — a group of people that started off as members and evolved, probably into this beautiful team and beyond anything the best of friends I know of.

Here's the team that's better than the best that'll be handling the ops for SNUC BC for this academic year - 
@⁨~AA⁩ @⁨~Ananya⁩ @⁨~ஆதித்யா✨👑⁩ @⁨~Tara Krishna⁩ @⁨~Kavyaa Prakash⁩ @⁨~Muthu⁩ @⁨~Jonathan Azariah J⁩

Can't wait to come back with every chance we get!
