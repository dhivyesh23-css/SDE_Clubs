While I couldn't implement all the ideas or events I had in my mind, I’m happy with the fun quiz meets and events we were able to organize, they meant a lot.

@⁨~Parthiv Susarla⁩  and @⁨~Adithya A⁩ will be taking over the reins (or should I say... the buzzer?) from here on.

I’m sure everyone already part of this group and those who join down the line will get to enjoy quizzing.

If anyone ever wants to discuss quizzes, ideas, or just catch up feel free to reach out anytime :)

28/08/25, 10:02 am - +91 82476 67696: An X can be compared to the Howrah Bridge in terms of structural mechanics, as both rely on the principle of a cantilever beam. In this design, one end is anchored while the other end is free. When a load is applied to the free end, both the beam and the structure experience stresses and deflections. The core idea is to support significant weight with minimal external support. Just like the Howrah Bridge, the X must bear substantial loads efficiently.
