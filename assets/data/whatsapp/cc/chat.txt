https://snucdelta.notion.site/Making-API-Calls-in-Javascript-123ec99419b38018a260f7a5f030ba70?pvs=4

a bunch of people who are attempting the task from today’s session reached out with a bunch of questions. to help people who have questions and not asked them as well, i’ve written a quick guide sorta document outlining making api requests in javascript

feel free to reach out with any questions you might have, or if any part of this guide is a little unclear. 

and im super happy with the number of people who are attempting the task even tho we didnt have enough time to cover everything in the session. 

tomorrow make sure to brainwash your friends who might not be attempting to task to do it give it a try as well 😛

this was the course i kept talking about in the session. you can use this if you feel like you want a more guided environment to get a hang of writing javascript code.

Hi everyone, this is shared to help you learn and understand the fundamentals of JavaScript. 
Completing and learning from this will be beneficial for you. 
However, not completing it will not impact the criteria used to select students for mentorship. It is based only on your performance and interest later.

Please ensure that your academic work is not interrupted by any of these activities and plan accordingly.

Happy coding!

20/10/24, 3:27 pm - Joshua Anna AI DS SNUC: Guys please keep in mind that at the end of the day, it’s important that you learn to manage your time spent on the curriculum and time spend on whats beyond the curriculum. 

unfortunately thats something which we cannot help you in and is something you get used to at an individual bases. We can however tell you with confidence that it’s very important you do so.

Our academic calendar is built in such a way that there is always some test or the other at any given month. This means that unless you figure out a way to study when you need to study, and dedicate other time to work, you would never be able to find time.

Striking that balance is only possible through trial and error and might be especially hard if this is the first semester exams you are facing, but i really urge everyone to make sure you satisfy your academic needs while being aware that it shouldn’t be the _only_ thing you are doing

20/10/24, 10:37 pm - Joshua Anna AI DS SNUC: Hey all, reminder for tomorrow’s session!

now that we have some basic js syntax out of the way, we will continue to understand what an API is, learn to use one, and and build one with this library called express js!

we are finally getting into a place where we can build some meaningful stuff lol, rather than write silly programs like writing into a file and reading form it :p

timings are 1:15-3:30pm 
and at AB3 seminar hall

this would be our last offline session. looking forward to seeing you all in person for the last time for a long time!
20/10/24, 10:38 pm - Joshua Anna AI DS SNUC: 2nd year people, whoever having cat tomorrow, can someone dm me the contact details and name of the faculty? i’ll try talking to them to possibly move the timings

If you have something to add on please do @⁨Joshua Anna AI DS SNUC⁩
21/10/24, 4:05 pm - Joshua Anna AI DS SNUC: Can confirm. 

Just keep in mind that the data should be stored on the server and you will only interract with the data via the api you define

Hey Guys,

Ever wondered how Midjourney crafts incredible artwork from simple prompts, or how Spotify knows exactly which song you'll want to hear next?
That’s the magic of Data Science & Machine Learning — and it’s time for YOU to discover it!

TL;DR:
Date: 28-10-2024 (That's Monday, folks!)
Time: 1 - 2.30 PM IST
Location: AB3 Seminar Hall

If you’ve been asking yourself…
“Where do I start with Data Science and ML?”
“Do I need to be a coding expert to get into ML?”

We know there are a lot of events happening, but we’d love for you to join us for the "Your First Steps in Data Science and ML" session hosted by the SNUC Coding Club tomorrow at AB3 Seminar Hall from 1 PM IST onwards. This isn't just another tech talk...it’s an opportunity to get hands-on, ask questions, and really dive into topics in DS and beyond.

Agenda

- Conceptual Clarity: Understand complex concepts through relatable, real-world examples.
- Career Insights: What skills does the market need, and how can you get started learning them?
- Hands-on Learning: Live coding session covering the ML Pipeline.
- Q&A

Finally, we are launching a resource blog that will cover a lot of information to help you get started and enhance your journey in this field (details will be shared during the event). We look forward to seeing you there :)

28/10/24, 11:49 pm - Joshua Anna AI DS SNUC: Hi all, 

Here are the CC there are a load of things that we want to do, yet so little time. rather so little “Mondays”.

We being a non residential college, means half the population wouldn’t be available in person for hands on stuff post 3:30PM.

(There are a set of buses that leave at 5:45PM which go to almost any place in chennai)

The culture we’ve had for the past few years indicated that sessions after 3:30PM until 5:30PM, didn’t make sense.

However a bunch of have some gut feels that this might have changed with the freshers batch. That the culture has changed to a point where most people would be willing to stay back for more serious skill development opportunities.

We wanted to confirm if this hypothesis is true. Please vote in the poll below

30/10/24, 10:14 pm - Joshua Anna AI DS SNUC: Okay thanks for the data people
30/10/24, 10:15 pm - Joshua Anna AI DS SNUC: i spoke to a bunch of you regarding sessions over diwali and the emotion has been pretty strong lol. so im assuming its better to have it in the post nov 3rd.

in the meantime, i am preparing a mini project guide document so that you dont loose touch. will likely drop it tonight or early tomorrow

Greetings from Coding Club,

Ever wondered if you could turn your command line into a Swiss Army knife of security tricks? Well, wonder no more! We're kicking off Session 1 of the Offensive Security Workshop — where things are about to get seriously hands-on.

Here's what’s in store:
📅 Date: November 11, 2024 (clear your calendars!)
🕒 Time: 1:30 - 3:30 PM (plenty of time for awesome exploits)
📍 Location: AB3 Seminar Hall (where the magic happens)

Agenda Highlights:
🔹 GNU/Linux Overview – Let’s start with the basics and make Linux our best friend.
🔹 Mastering the Command Line – Get cozy with commands; trust us, it’s a superpower.
🔹 Bash Like a Pro – We’ll break down Bash, one clever trick at a time.
🔹 Exploiting with Bash and Command Line Tools – Finally, the fun part! Let’s dive into some real, hands-on exploitation.

Whether you’re a command-line newbie or already a ninja, there’s something here for everyone. No pre-requisites, no pressure — just you, your curiosity, and a terminal waiting for your commands. Make sure to show up, because this is one session you won’t want to miss!

Let’s get ready to hack (legally, of course)! See you there!

22/07/25, 1:25 pm - Joshua Anna AI DS SNUC: IT WILL yes
28/07/25, 3:28 pm - Joshua Anna AI DS SNUC: Hey all. It seems like only those  who are shortlisted will get the link to the online assesment. 

The links are not sent out yet, need not worry. It will be sent out in the next few minutes
28/07/25, 3:32 pm - Joshua Anna AI DS SNUC: Update: TEST WILL HAPPEN TODAY. 

Links will be sent out at 4pm.

I understand this sucks because you will have to miss the bus without context on wether or not you are shortlisted

But we tried our best to get the list. It seems like sourcing the list right now would take longer than 4pm <This message was edited>

1. Left home because you didn't notice your name in SSN list
2. Didn't get link at all

Please dm me asap
28/07/25, 8:46 pm - Joshua Anna AI DS SNUC: I heard that there has been information that has circulated that only people who were on the list, but didn't attend the test today, will be able to attend it at 830am tomorrow.

This is false 

Only people affected in the below criteria will be allowed to attend:
1. Shortlist issues: intermixing between SSN and snu lists
2. Platform issues: name was on the list, but didn't get mail
3. Anticheat issues: wrongly blocked out by anticheat false positives
4. Delayed resolutions: those who got above issues resolved very late and didn't have ample time to take the test properly.

There will be no other case where retaking in the morning tomorrow will be permitted.

31/08/25, 12:05 pm - +91 75500 33654: In most cases

31/08/25, 12:05 pm - +91 96863 21885: Useful for them then, as long as there’s no clause stating they can’t have multiple scholarships
31/08/25, 12:06 pm - +91 99406 44288: Yeah since in cybersecurity our mam gave us case studies of something similar na and I am still not comfortable with the names 😞

31/08/25, 8:54 pm - +91 95977 74031: Any particular softwares that need to be installed in our laptops for tmr's workshop?
31/08/25, 8:56 pm - +91 72043 97677: maybe get a bootable version of a pentesting specialized operating system like kali/parrot. or atleast get a version of linux ready (maybe WSL)
31/08/25, 8:56 pm - +91 72043 97677: but there's no hard requirements
31/08/25, 8:56 pm - +91 80803 23242: WSL should be enough.
31/08/25, 8:56 pm - +91 99806 96238: This, I'd personally recommend WSL, or Windows Subsystem for Linux.
31/08/25, 8:58 pm - +91 95977 74031: Thanks

31/08/25, 10:03 pm - +91 99402 55513: WSL?
31/08/25, 10:03 pm - +91 99402 55513: Ive had enuf trauma with wsl
31/08/25, 10:03 pm - Narendra S CS SNUC: what did bro run into
31/08/25, 10:04 pm - +91 99402 55513: I wld say, dont use wsl unless you really know your shit
31/08/25, 10:04 pm - +91 94896 87324: it's literally just clicking a few buttons-
31/08/25, 10:04 pm - +91 99402 55513: Everything is fine until u have to uninstall it
31/08/25, 10:04 pm - Narendra S CS SNUC: microsoft ☕
31/08/25, 10:04 pm - +91 99402 55513: 😭
31/08/25, 10:05 pm - +91 94896 87324: just...uninstall? 😭 I've uninstalled it before, am I missing something?
31/08/25, 10:05 pm - +91 88387 11459: Wsl peak though, legit peak engineering
31/08/25, 10:05 pm - +91 80803 23242: can confirm
31/08/25, 10:05 pm - +91 94896 87324: if only wsa received similar love 😔
31/08/25, 10:05 pm - +91 99402 55513: No the thing is it got integrated with vs code for some reason and in first year i had no clue what was happening and was legit freaking out
31/08/25, 10:06 pm - +91 99402 55513: Real but using wsl without knowing how to, is kinda hard
31/08/25, 10:06 pm - Narendra S CS SNUC: you just have to uninstall the wsl vscode extension
31/08/25, 10:06 pm - +91 94896 87324: sir you had a project in the wsl directories then
31/08/25, 10:06 pm - Narendra S CS SNUC: unless you installed vsc within wsl or smth
31/08/25, 10:06 pm - +91 99402 55513: I did da
31/08/25, 10:06 pm - +91 88387 11459: Didn't... wsa get discontinued
31/08/25, 10:06 pm - +91 99402 55513: Yes
31/08/25, 10:06 pm - +91 94896 87324: yes 😔
31/08/25, 10:08 pm - +91 94896 87324: Microsoft should've bit the bullet and begged google for google play integration
31/08/25, 10:08 pm - +91 94896 87324: having amazon app store as the only way for normal consumers to install apps, plus the complexity of installing it as a regular user killed it mainly <This message was edited>
31/08/25, 10:09 pm - Narendra S CS SNUC: ~waydroid~
31/08/25, 10:10 pm - +91 94440 41895: Wait at that point isn't it easier to use
31/08/25, 10:10 pm - +91 94440 41895: Vms
31/08/25, 10:10 pm - +91 94440 41895: Instead of struggling with windows
31/08/25, 10:10 pm - Narendra S CS SNUC: they _are_ vms
31/08/25, 10:10 pm - +91 94440 41895: Oh

31/08/25, 10:11 pm - +91 93612 41992: what you on about, wsl quite literally beginner shit
31/08/25, 10:11 pm - +91 93612 41992: better than VMs if you don't have the memory or dual boot
31/08/25, 10:12 pm - +91 94440 41895: Wait so if you use wsl can you install packages and all that normally?
31/08/25, 10:12 pm - +91 94440 41895: Or is there extra steps
31/08/25, 10:12 pm - +91 93612 41992: you just connected vsc to remote wsl 😭
you open vsc on a local folder and it goes away :/
31/08/25, 10:13 pm - Narendra S CS SNUC: yeah?
31/08/25, 10:13 pm - Narendra S CS SNUC: and if you're wsl2 (which you most likely are) you can use linux gui apps too

31/08/25, 10:13 pm - +91 94440 41895: Just chumma clarifying
31/08/25, 10:14 pm - +91 93612 41992: could've asked any of the seniors know, you're friends with all the nerds 💀
31/08/25, 10:14 pm - +91 99402 55513: One of those specific nerds forced me into installing wsl
31/08/25, 10:15 pm - Narendra S CS SNUC:

31/08/25, 10:19 pm - +91 94440 41895: Arch was first resulg
31/08/25, 10:19 pm - +91 94440 41895: Installed it

31/08/25, 10:19 pm - +91 88387 11459: Bros running pmaos
31/08/25, 10:19 pm - Narendra S CS SNUC: objectively there isn't an answer

31/08/25, 10:19 pm - Narendra S CS SNUC: last week
31/08/25, 10:19 pm - Narendra S CS SNUC: I have been since feb
31/08/25, 10:19 pm - +91 98400 20605: Nix is one of the best distros 🙏
31/08/25, 10:20 pm - +91 98400 20605: and by Light which parameter are you referring to?
31/08/25, 10:20 pm - Narendra S CS SNUC: this tbh, light is pretty subjective
31/08/25, 10:20 pm - Narendra S CS SNUC: arch is just minimal ootb; and not the only distro out there that is minimal
31/08/25, 10:20 pm - +91 94440 41895: Well by light I meant what didnt have as many background processes
31/08/25, 10:20 pm - +91 98400 20605: Yeah but let's just assume he is referring to Memory Consumption when the system is Idle
31/08/25, 10:21 pm - +91 94440 41895: That took up ram
31/08/25, 10:21 pm - Narendra S CS SNUC: heck it isn't even the most minimal if you wanna go by that metric
31/08/25, 10:21 pm - Narendra S CS SNUC: I ran debian with kde on a dabba from 2013 with 4 gigs of ddr3 <This message was edited>
31/08/25, 10:21 pm - +91 94896 87324: For most people, light is something lighter than windows, and the safest option where everything works is ubuntu imo
31/08/25, 10:21 pm - +91 98400 20605: Vanilla Debian is OP <This message was edited>
31/08/25, 10:21 pm - +91 94440 41895: Cool

ChatGPT isn’t magic — it’s built on tokens, embeddings, and math.
This session breaks down how Large Language Models (LLMs) actually work, why they sometimes go wrong, and what they can (and can’t) do.

What you’ll learn:
• How LLMs process language
• Why ChatGPT makes mistakes
• Where AI is powerful, and where it fails

📅 3rd Sept (Wed)
🕒 12:45 – 3:30 PM
📍 AB3, Room 247

Open to all — especially beginners and the GenAI-curious.
