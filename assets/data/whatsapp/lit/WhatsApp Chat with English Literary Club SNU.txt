21/08/25, 12:00 pm - +91 89251 49937: Hey y'all!!

A huge welcome to all our juniors and new members of the ELC!! ✨✨

Think of this club as a safe haven - a space where all personalities belong, whether you’re the quiet soul who pours magic through a quill, or the bold voice that lights up the room with words. 
Here, there’s no judgement, just freedom - to express, to explore, and to be *_unapologetically you._* 

From poetry to debates, stories to performances, we celebrate every shade of expression. The ELC isn’t just about the language , we're about finding your voice, and letting it resonate in your own unique way.🪶

Looking forward to a great year! 

Rejoice!🥂
